# E-commerce Analysis
In this project we use MySQL Workbench to explore  an
eCommerce Database for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an online
retailer which has just launched their first product.

Analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure and test website conversion
performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches.
