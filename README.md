In this project we use MySQL Workbench to explore  an
eCommerce Database for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an online
retailer which has just launched their first product.

Analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure and test website conversion
performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches.


### Use SQL to: 

- Access and explore the Maven Fuzzy Factory database
- Analyze and optimize the businessâ€™ marketing channels, website, and product portfolio

### Traffic Analysis Optimization

Identify top traffic sources, measure their conversion rates,
analyze trends, and use segmentation for bidding optimization


### Website Measurement & Testing

Find the most
visited pages and top entry pages, calculate
bounce rates, build conversion funnels, and analyze tests
